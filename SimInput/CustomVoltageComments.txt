#Defines the entire workspace the circuit sits within
SHEET 1 880 680

Coordinates for the wires: : [Bottom X, Bottom Y, Top X, Top Y]
WIRE 64 160 64 128
WIRE 64 272 64 240

#This is Ground. Probably the location of the port.
FLAG 64 272 0

#This is the label tag
FLAG 64 48 VLabel

#Probably sets the label to an output port
IOPIN 64 48 Out

#The height of a voltage element is 256-176 = 80
#The separation between voltage elements (that visually looks alright) = 176-144 = 32
#The separation between the last voltage element and ground is: 272-256 = 16

#In order to add a new element, we need to add a new wire, and a new voltage source.
#Therefore the previous 2nd argument in the Flag 0 height should be increased by 112

#For the voltage symbol itself, add 112 between them as well.

###My attempted custom addition appended to the file:
WIRE 64 288 64 256
SYMBOL voltage 64 272 R0
WINDOW 123 0 0 Left 2
WINDOW 39 0 0 Left 2
SYMATTR InstName V3
SYMATTR Value PULSE(0 69 10 .1 .1 1 3 10)

also changed the following by adding 112 to them.
FLAG 64 272 0
WIRE 64 272 64 256

#Algo: Delete wire and line associated w/ Flag 0.
Append to the file with the sources, finally followed
by the Flag 0 and updated associated wire.

Okay, so here's what I need:
1.) Move all of the code into a function that will be imported into the main
func.
2.)
